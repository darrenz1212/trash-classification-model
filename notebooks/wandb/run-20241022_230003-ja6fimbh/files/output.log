C:\Users\User\anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\keras\src\layers\reshaping\flatten.py:37: UserWarning: Do not pass an `input_shape`/`input_dim` argument to a layer. When using Sequential models, prefer using an `Input(shape)` object as the first layer in the model instead.
  flattening adds an extra channel dimension and output shape is `(batch, 1)`.

WARNING:tensorflow:5 out of the last 5 calls to <function TensorFlowTrainer.make_train_function.<locals>.one_step_on_iterator at 0x0000017D9B749080> triggered tf.function retracing. Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.
